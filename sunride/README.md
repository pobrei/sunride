# SunRide Project Structure

This directory contains the new modular structure for the SunRide project. The project is being migrated from the legacy structure to this new modular structure.

## Directory Structure

- `frontend/`: Contains the Next.js application and UI components
- `backend/`: Contains API routes and server-side logic
- `shared/`: Contains shared code used by both frontend and backend

## Migration Status

The project is currently in a transition phase. Some code is still in the legacy structure (in the `src/` directory), while new code is being added to this modular structure.

For more information, see the main README.md file in the root directory.
