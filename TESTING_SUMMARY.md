# Testing Strategy Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive testing strategy for the Weather App project, focusing on unit tests, integration tests, and component tests. The tests are organized by type and component, making it easy to find and run specific tests.

## Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation

  - GPX parser
  - Weather data validation
  - Distance calculations
  - API hooks

- **Component Tests**: Test UI components

  - GPX Uploader
  - Map
  - Timeline
  - Weather display

- **Integration Tests**: Test how components work together
  - GPX upload flow
  - Weather data merging
  - Route visualization

## Test Files

We've created the following test files:

1. **GPX Parser Tests**

   - `gpxParser.test.ts`: Tests for parsing GPX files, calculating distances, and generating forecast points

2. **Weather Service Tests**

   - `weatherService.test.ts`: Tests for validating weather data and synchronizing time zones
   - `weatherDataMerging.test.ts`: Tests for merging weather data with route points
   - `distanceSampling.test.ts`: Tests for sampling route points at regular intervals

3. **Component Tests**

   - `GPXUploader.test.tsx`: Tests for the GPX file upload component
   - `Map.test.tsx`: Tests for the map visualization component
   - `Timeline.test.tsx`: Tests for the timeline navigation component
   - `Charts.test.tsx`: Tests for the chart visualization components
   - `SafeChartsWrapper.test.tsx`: Tests for the chart error boundary component

4. **API Hook Tests**

   - `useWeatherAPI.test.ts`: Tests for the weather API hook

5. **Integration Tests**
   - `GPXUploadFlow.test.tsx`: Tests for the complete GPX upload flow
   - `WeatherDataFlow.test.tsx`: Tests for the weather data fetching and processing flow

## Mock Data and Utilities

We've created mock data and utilities to support testing:

- Mock GPX data
- Mock weather data
- Mock API responses
- Test utilities for rendering components with providers

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm run test:file -- <pattern>
```

## Error Handling Tests

We've added specific tests for error handling:

1. **GPX Parser Error Tests**

   - `gpxParserErrors.test.ts`: Tests for handling invalid GPX files, missing data, and format errors

2. **Weather API Error Tests**

   - `weatherAPIErrors.test.ts`: Tests for handling network errors, API errors, and invalid responses

3. **UI Error Handling Tests**
   - `ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`: Tests for the error boundary component that catches and displays errors
   - `Notifications.test.tsx`: Tests for the notification system that displays error messages

## CI/CD Setup

We've set up GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment:

1. **Test Workflow**

   - Runs on push to main and pull requests
   - Runs linting, type checking, and tests
   - Generates and uploads coverage reports

2. **Deploy Workflow**
   - Runs on push to main
   - Runs tests before deployment
   - Deploys to Vercel

## Next Steps

1. **Run and Debug Tests**: Run the tests and fix any remaining issues
2. **Improve Test Coverage**: Aim for 70%+ coverage of core functionality
3. **Add End-to-End Tests**: Consider adding Cypress or Playwright tests for complete user flows
4. **Set Up Codecov**: Add a Codecov token to GitHub secrets to track coverage over time

## Test Execution

To run specific tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:file -- <pattern>
```

For example:

```bash
# Run GPX parser tests
npm run test:file -- gpxParser

# Run weather data tests
npm run test:file -- weather

# Run all utility tests
npm run test:file -- utils
```
