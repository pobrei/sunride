# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Weather App project.

## Testing Structure

Tests are organized in two ways:

1. **Co-located tests**: Test files placed alongside the source files they test (`Component.test.tsx` next to `Component.tsx`)
2. **Grouped tests**: Tests placed in the `__tests__` directory, mirroring the source directory structure

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Mock all external dependencies
- Focus on input/output and state changes
- Located in `__tests__/unit` or co-located with source files

### Integration Tests

- Test how components work together
- May use partial mocking of external services
- Focus on component interactions
- Located in `__tests__/integration`

### End-to-End Tests (Future)

- Test complete user flows
- Minimal mocking, use test environments
- Focus on user experience
- Located in `cypress` or `e2e` directory

## Test Naming Conventions

- Unit tests: `describe('functionName', () => { it('should do something', () => {}) })`
- Component tests: `describe('ComponentName', () => { it('should render correctly', () => {}) })`
- Integration tests: `describe('Feature: Description', () => { it('should work when user does something', () => {}) })`

## Mocks and Fixtures

- API mocks in `__tests__/mocks/api`
- Data fixtures in `__tests__/fixtures`
- Component mocks in `__tests__/mocks/components`

## Test Coverage Goals

- Core utilities: 90%+ coverage
- UI components: 80%+ coverage
- Integration tests: Cover all main user flows

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.js
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test behavior, not implementation**: Focus on what the code does, not how it does it
2. **Keep tests independent**: Each test should run in isolation
3. **Use descriptive test names**: Clearly describe what is being tested
4. **Follow AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
5. **Mock external dependencies**: Don't rely on external services in unit tests
6. **Test edge cases**: Include tests for error conditions and boundary values
7. **Keep tests fast**: Optimize for quick feedback cycles
8. **Maintain test code quality**: Refactor tests as needed, just like production code
